README file for Tic-Tac-Toe

Currently, this tic-tac-toe game supports local multiplayer. The game keeps track of each player's total wins,
while switching between who goes first each game. There is a new game button that can be pressed after a game is over,
or during if the users would like. Player 1 is always X's, while player 2 is always O's.

In future versions, I would like to implement a player vs AI option and a networked 1v1 option. In addition, I would
like to make it so players can customize their names and have the winning spots turn green when a win occurs.
