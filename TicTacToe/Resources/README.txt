Currently, this tic-tac-toe game supports local multiplayer and playing against an AI. The game keeps track of each player's total wins,
while switching between who goes first each game. There is a new game button that can be pressed after a game is over,
or during if the users would like.

The AI has 3 difficulty levels - easy, hard, and impossible. On easy, the AI plays random moves, each with equal probability. On hard, the AI
always makes winning moves (completes 3 in a row if there are already 2 of the 3 moves made) and blocks losses if possible (the opponent getting
3 in a row on the subsequent move). On impossible difficulty, the AI will never lose.... (FINISH)
